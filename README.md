🧠 IEP Paperwork Workhorse
A click-to-run automation tool I built while managing a caseload of 94 speech therapy students.
It saved me hours of IEP-related documentation and kept me organized under pressure.

💡 What It Does:
Reads a folder full of IEP PDFs

Extracts student names, ID numbers, and goals

Creates structured Excel and Word documents

Auto-generates folders for each student

Fills each with templated treatment notes & goals

Includes a GUI with a dropdown to view any student’s goals instantly

🖥️ How to Use:
No coding required. Just download the compiled version from:
